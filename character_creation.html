  <h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
  <p>The fallout adventure has always been about the journey of the player character, so we should probably get started with creating that character.</p>
  <p>To make things easy, we will be creating our character in a series of steps:</p>
  <h4 id="step-1-who-are-you-">Step 1: Who are you?</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>In this step, think of your character&#39;s background. Is he or she a vault dweller or something more creative? Think about your character&#39;s motivations, personality type, goals. Feel free to go as in depth as you like, however, it is important to have a clear background for your character before moving on, reference step 4 for some example backgrounds.</p>
  <h4 id="step-2-you-re-s-p-e-c-i-a-l-">Step 2: You&#39;re S.P.E.C.I.A.L.</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>In this step, you&#39;ll choose your player&#39;s S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. These skills are Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. These skills range between 1 and 10. Before customization, each skill starts at 5, with an additional 5 points to allocate however you wish. You may also reduce skills in order to work with more points, however, every skill must be at least 1, with a maximum of 10. You should allocate these points in a way that reflects your character&#39;s background. For example, if your character is a brutish human, raised on a farm with no education, the Strength skill should be high while the Intelligence should be low. This will help to role-play your character.</p>
  <h4 id="step-3-what-are-you-">Step 3: What are you?</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>In this step, you&#39;ll choose your character&#39;s physical appearance. You have several options.</p>
  <h6 id="pure-human">Pure Human</h6>
  <p>A &quot;Vault Dweller.&quot; You grew up in a vault, a healthy human with no genetic abnormalities. Because of the high-tech medicine in the vault <strong>you can add 2 additional points to your primary skills</strong></p>
  <h6 id="wasteland-human">Wasteland Human</h6>
  <p>A true citizen of the wasteland, you grew up dealing with the dangers of the wasteland. Because of this, you gain <strong>+2 resistance to chems and rads</strong></p>
  <h5 id="ghoul">Ghoul</h5>
  <p>Through exposure to radiation, you&#39;ve transformed into a ghoul. Some would consider you a monster, and you will eventually go feral.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>You receive half of the rads of your non-ghoul counterparts</strong></li>
  <li><strong>When your rads are under 50, you are healed for 1d4 * rads/2 per turn.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your appearance gives you -2 to Charisma.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your frail body is weak, -2 to Strength</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h6 id="super-mutant">Super Mutant</h6>
  <p>You&#39;ve transformed into a hulking super mutant by exposure to the Forced Evolutionary Virus.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>You have a rad resistance of 10</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Because of your body, take +1 to Damage Resistance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The virus gives you great strength, +2 to Strength</strong></li>
  <li><strong>You are a large being, a bit clumsy at times. -2 to Agility</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your appearance gives you -2 to Charisma.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="synthetic">Synthetic</h5>
  <p>You are an artificially created being. Whoever created you gave you sentience, and you mean to take advantage of it. Some would call you a robot, others a person.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Due to your robotic form you have poison and rad resistance of 10</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Due to your synthetic body, +2 to Damage Resistance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your creator didn&#39;t program you for much. All skills start at 0, except tag skills which are +2</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="abomination">Abomination</h5>
  <p>Radiation has created a freak of nature, you. You&#39;ve gotten lucky though, and you have human-level intelligence.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Due to your inception by rads, you have rad resistance of 10</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your body doesn&#39;t really work right, take -1 to all primary skills.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="step-4-what-did-you-do-">Step 4: What did you do?</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>In this step, you&#39;ll choose your background and be awarded with skill points based on your history.</p>
  <h5 id="vault-dweller">Vault Dweller</h5>
  <p>You were raised in a Vault-Tec vault.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>+10 to Science and Speech</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>+10 to Barter and Repair</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="wastelander">Wastelander</h5>
  <p>You were raised in the Wasteland. You lived by scavenging.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>+10 to Sneak and Lockpicking</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="tribal">Tribal</h5>
  <p>You were rasied in a nomadic tribal community, worshiping a spiritual god.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>+10 to Survival and Melee</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="raider">Raider</h5>
  <p>You were raised as a member of a raider or slaver gang.</p>

  </ul>
  <h5 id="slave">Slave</h5>
  <p>You are an escaped slave.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>+10 to Sneak and Survival</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="mystery">Mystery</h5>
  <p>Your background is a mystery, reveal it later! (Don&#39;t be lazy and choose this option because you don&#39;t want to come up with a background)</p>
  <h5 id="other">Other</h5>
  <p>Choose another background, consult your GM for +10 to 2 appropriate skills</p>
  <h4 id="step-5-what-are-your-traits-">Step 5: What are your traits?</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>You may select 1 trait from the trait list in the appendix. All traits have a positive and negative side, so choose carefully. Taking a trait is optional.</p>
  <p>At each new level, you may pick a perk, starting the first time you level up, so don&#39;t do this yet, just remember it later.</p>
  <h5 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h5>
  <p>Hit points are determined as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Starting HP = (Endurance + Strength) x 5</strong></li>
  <li><strong>HP per Level = 1D10 + Endurance modifier</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="action-points">Action Points</h5>
  <p>You can calculate your AP as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>AP = 1 + Agility Modifier (+ any other mods)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some examples of things that use Action Points are</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Firing a gun</li>
  <li>Making a melee attack</li>
  <li>Reloading</li>
  <li>Using an item</li>
  <li>Blocking</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AP points do not rollover from round to round, so use them!</p>
  <h5 id="resistances">Resistances</h5>
  <p>Resistances give the character a chance to avoid being affected by an effect. Unless noted, resistances are 0 by default, with a max of 100.  </p>
  <p>When you encounter an effect, roll a d100. If your rolled number is lower than your resistance level, you are not affected.</p>
  <h5 id="unarmed-damage">Unarmed Damage</h5>
  <p>Base unarmed damage is calcualted as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>1 + (Str 1-4: 0, 5-7: 1, 8-9: 2, 10: 3)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="skill-points-per-level">Skill Points Per Level</h5>
  <p>Every time you level up, you earn skill points. Calculate how many with this formula:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>10 + (Int 1-4: 0, 5-7: 10, 8-9: 20, 10: 30)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="carry-weight-">Carry Weight:</h5>
  <p>Total amount of stuff you can carry.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Normal: <strong>50 + (Str x 10)</strong></li>
  <li>Small Frame: <strong>50 + (Str x 5)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="sequence">Sequence</h5>
  <p>Your placement in the round.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Perception + 1D10</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="step-6-what-are-you-good-at-">Step 6: What are you good at?</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>One of the most important parts of your character is your proficiency in certain skills. When starting out, the player must choose which skills to allocate points to.</p>
  <p>To determine what the starting value of each skill is, use the following formula.</p>
  <p><strong>Stat 1-4: 0, 5-7: 10, 8-9: 20, 10: 3</strong></p>
  <p>Where &quot;Stat&quot; is the governing stat for the skill. See the table below to find which stats correspond to which skills.</p>

  <p>After you have allocated those points, you are given <strong>100 free skill points to allocate however you wish</strong></p>
  <h5 id="tag-skills">Tag skills</h5>
  <p>Each player may select 3 skills that will be &quot;Tag Skills.&quot; These are skills that the character will be good at the beginning, so choose wisely. Each tag skill get <strong>+10 to the skill</strong></p>
  <h4 id="step-7-everything-else-">Step 7: Everything else.</h4>
  <p>Now is the time to really flesh out your character. What do they look like? What is their name?</p>
  <p>Work with your GM to determine what gear you start with.</p>
  <p>That&#39;s it, you&#39;re on your way!</p>
