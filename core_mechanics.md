Core Gameplay Mechanics

The Fallout series has always allowed to the player to do almost anything that they please.

#### Combat

###### Ranged Combat
All ranged combat is based on hit percentages. The formula for calculating hit percentage is as follows:

``` hit_percent = (skill/2) + max(0, (100-distance*2))) + 1d12 ```

Roll a d100, and if the number you roll is less than the hit percentage, you hit. Roll Damage.

###### Melee Combat

Unarmed: ``` hit_percent = (unarmed skill / 2) + (100 - AP*10)```

Melee: ``` hit_percent = melee skill```
