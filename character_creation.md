Character Creation
---
The fallout adventure has always been about the journey of the player character, so we should probably get started with creating that character.

To make things easy, we will be creating our character in a series of steps:


#### Step 1: Who are you?
---
In this step, think of your character's background. Is he or she a vault dweller or something more creative? Think about your character's motivations, personality type, goals. Feel free to go as in depth as you like, however, it is important to have a clear background for your character before moving on, reference step 4 for some example backgrounds.

#### Step 2: You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
In this step, you'll choose your player's S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. These skills are Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. These skills range between 1 and 10. Before customization, each skill starts at 5, with an additional 5 points to allocate however you wish. You may also reduce skills in order to work with more points, however, every skill must be at least 1, with a maximum of 10. You should allocate these points in a way that reflects your character's background. For example, if your character is a brutish human, raised on a farm with no education, the Strength skill should be high while the Intelligence should be low. This will help to role-play your character.

#### Step 3: What are you?
---
In this step, you'll choose your character's physical appearance. You have several options.

###### Pure Human
A "Vault Dweller." You grew up in a vault, a healthy human with no genetic abnormalities. Because of the high-tech medicine in the vault __you can add 2 additional points to your primary skills__

###### Wasteland Human
A true citizen of the wasteland, you grew up dealing with the dangers of the wasteland. Because of this, you gain __+2 resistance to chems and rads__

##### Ghoul
Through exposure to radiation, you've transformed into a ghoul. Some would consider you a monster, and you will eventually go feral.
* __You receive half of the rads of your non-ghoul counterparts__
* __When your rads are under 50, you are healed for 1d4 * rads/2 per turn.__
*  __Your appearance gives you -2 to Charisma.__
* __Your frail body is weak, -2 to Strength__

###### Super Mutant
You've transformed into a hulking super mutant by exposure to the Forced Evolutionary Virus.
* __You have a rad resistance of 10__
* __Because of your body, take +1 to Damage Resistance__
* __The virus gives you great strength, +2 to Strength__
* __You are a large being, a bit clumsy at times. -2 to Agility__
*  __Your appearance gives you -2 to Charisma.__

##### Synthetic
You are an artificially created being. Whoever created you gave you sentience, and you mean to take advantage of it. Some would call you a robot, others a person.

* __Due to your robotic form you have poison and rad resistance of 10__
* __Due to your synthetic body, +2 to Damage Resistance__
* __Your creator didn't program you for much. All skills start at 0, except tag skills which are +2__

##### Abomination
Radiation has created a freak of nature, you. You've gotten lucky though, and you have human-level intelligence.
* __Due to your inception by rads, you have rad resistance of 10__
* __Your body doesn't really work right, take -1 to all primary skills.__

#### Step 4: What did you do?
---
In this step, you'll choose your background and be awarded with skill points based on your history.

##### Vault Dweller
You were raised in a Vault-Tec vault.
* __+10 to Science and Speech__

##### City Dweller
You were raised in a large city in the Wasteland.
* __+10 to Barter and Repair__

##### Wastelander
You were raised in the Wasteland. You lived by scavenging.
* __+10 to Sneak and Lockpicking__

##### Tribal
You were rasied in a nomadic tribal community, worshiping a spiritual god.
* __+10 to Survival and Melee__

##### Raider
You were raised as a member of a raider or slaver gang.
* __-15 Karma, Chem Tolerant trait (free)__

##### Slave
You are an escaped slave.
* __+10 to Sneak and Survival__

##### Mystery
Your background is a mystery, reveal it later! (Don't be lazy and choose this option because you don't want to come up with a background)

##### Other
Choose another background, consult your GM for +10 to 2 appropriate skills

#### Step 5: What are your traits?
---
You may select 1 trait from the trait list in the appendix. All traits have a positive and negative side, so choose carefully. Taking a trait is optional.

At each new level, you may pick a perk, starting the first time you level up, so don't do this yet, just remember it later.

##### Hit Points
Hit points are determined as follows:
* __Starting HP = (Endurance + Strength) x 5__
* __HP per Level = 1D10 + Endurance modifier__

##### Action Points
You can calculate your AP as follows:
* __AP = 1 + Agility Modifier (+ any other mods)__

Some examples of things that use Action Points are
* Firing a gun
* Making a melee attack
* Reloading
* Using an item
* Blocking

AP points do not rollover from round to round, so use them!

##### Resistances
Resistances give the character a chance to avoid being affected by an effect. Unless noted, resistances are 0 by default, with a max of 100.  

When you encounter an effect, roll a d100. If your rolled number is lower than your resistance level, you are not affected.

##### Unarmed Damage
Base unarmed damage is calcualted as follows:
* __1 + (Str 1-4: 0, 5-7: 1, 8-9: 2, 10: 3)__

##### Skill Points Per Level
Every time you level up, you earn skill points. Calculate how many with this formula:
* __10 + (Int 1-4: 0, 5-7: 10, 8-9: 20, 10: 30)__

##### Carry Weight:
Total amount of stuff you can carry.
* Normal: __50 + (Str x 10)__
* Small Frame: __50 + (Str x 5)__

##### Sequence
Your placement in the round.
* __Perception + 1D10__

#### Step 6: What are you good at?
---
One of the most important parts of your character is your proficiency in certain skills. When starting out, the player must choose which skills to allocate points to.

To determine what the starting value of each skill is, use the following formula.

__Stat 1-4: 0, 5-7: 10, 8-9: 20, 10: 30__

Where "Stat" is the governing stat for the skill. See the table below to find which stats correspond to which skills.

| Skill | Stat |
|:-----:|:----:|
| Barter| Charisma |
| Big Guns | Endurance |
| Energy Weapons | Perception |
| Explosives | Perception |
| Lockpick | Agility |
| Medicine | Intelligence |
| Melee Weapons | Strength |
| Pilot | Perception |
| Repair | Intelligence|
| Science | Intelligence |
| Small Guns | Agility |
| Sneak | Agility |
| Speech | Charisma |
| Steal | Agility |
| Survival | Endurance |
| Unarmed | Strength |

After you have allocated those points, you are given __15 free skill points to allocate however you wish__

##### Tag skills
Each player may select 3 skills that will be "Tag Skills." These are skills that the character will be good at the beginning, so choose wisely. Each tag skill get __+10 to the skill__

#### Step 7: Everything else.
Now is the time to really flesh out your character. What do they look like? What is their name?

Work with your GM to determine what gear you start with.

That's it, you're on your way!
